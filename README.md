## Project Description
This project is part of COMP3104 (DevOps).  
It demonstrates our understanding of DevOps practices such as version control, branching strategy, CI/CD pipelines, and collaboration through GitHub.

## CI/CD Setup
- CI is configured using GitHub Actions.  
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`  
- Every push to the repository triggers automated builds and tests.

## Branch Strategy
- `main`: stable branch  
- `dev`: integration branch  
- Feature branches: each member has their own (e.g., `101449183-Mehdi`)
