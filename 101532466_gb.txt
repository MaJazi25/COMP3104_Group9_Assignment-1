George Brown College Foundation

The George Brown College Foundation aims to raise enough funds to create at least 40 scholarships,
ranging between $500-$1,000 each, for our future frontline workers for the Fall.
Students who show dedication to their field of study, community involvement and demonstrate financial
need will qualify.
